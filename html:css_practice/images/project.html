    <p>FKA Twigs (born Tahliah Debrett Barnett 16.01.88) FKA Twigs is an English<br/>
        singer/songwriter best known for her August 2014 debut studio album, 'LP1'.<br/><br/>
       <b>Childhood:</b>  Tahliah Barnett was born in Gloucester, England, and raised by her <br/>
       mother and stepfather. She attended secondary school at St. Edward's School in <br/>
       Cheltenham, Gloucester, and started attending music related youth clubs at the age <br/>
       of sixteen. The following year, Barnett moved to London, where she began a career as <br/>
       a backing dancer for artists like Kylie Minogue, Taio Cruz and Ed Sheeran. She then <br/>
       appeared in a music video for Jessie J in 2010, before serving with her again in 2011.<br/><br>

       <b>Career:</b>In December 2012, Barentt (who had changed her name to FKA Twigs, with <br/>
       FKA standing for 'Formerly Known As' and 'Twigs' being her old childhood nick-name)<br/>
       self-released her musical debut. This came in the form of 'EP1', which debuted on<br/>
       Bandcamp. For each song, she released a video on her YouTube channel. In August,<br/>
       2013, Twigs released the music video for her first single on YouTube which was<br/>
       picked up by The Guardian five days later and became part of their 6th August "New<br/>
       Band of the Day" feature. In September of 2013, Twigs released her second EP,<br/>
       named 'EP2'. On 6th August, 2014, FKA Twigs released her debut studio album,<br/>
       'LP1'. It was nominated for the 2014 Mercury Prize.<br/> </p> <hr/>

        <p1>On LP1, Twigs expands her avant-pop landscape, yielding "boundaries-pushing" pop music.<br/>
            Indeed, Entertainment Weekly felt that without Twigs' voice, it would be a work of avant-garde electronics. <br/>
            It is seen for its "glitchy futuristic" take on R&B, casting the genre in "thrilling hyper-real hues".
